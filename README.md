## Introduction
This repo contains the python implementation of Bai-Pollicott algorithm to compute the Lyapunov exponent for i.i.d. and Markovian products of random matrices. The original algorithm is based on the article {insert Bai} {insert Pollicott} and improved in my own paper {insert my paper}.
